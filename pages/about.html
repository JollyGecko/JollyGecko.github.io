                    <h2>Welcome</h2>
                    <p>I'm César, a software developer with a side passion for music, books and puzzles! 
                    I studied mathematics in college, with an emphasis in computational and applied mathematics, which mean I now dream in equations.</p>
                    <p>I started this endeavor at University of Coimbra, before moving to IST in Lisbon for my master's.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Whether you are lost, or came here on purpose, welcome!</p>
                    <br>
                </div>

                    <h2>Professional Growth</h2>
                    <p>I started my path in software development in the insurance & banking sector. 
                        This experience was transformative – I learned to work with real end clients, manage deadlines, and collaborate with diverse teams.
                        The fast-paced environment pushed me to grow quickly and adapt to new technologies.</p>
                    <p>From there, I went into the automotive industry, working on features for autonomous driving. 
                        The research driven approach has presented a very interesting challenge, along with the criticality of the product, which lead me to 
                        improve code in terms of safety.</p>
                </div>

                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>When I'm not teaching C++ to a car, you can usually find me strumming my guitar, 
                        pretending my keyboard skills are something to write home about, or rocking out with my band.</p>

                        <div class="img-caption">Lisbon concert</div>
                    </div>
                    <p>Playing live gigs is one of the most thrilling things I do — there's something irreplaceable about connecting with people through music, in real time, at full volume.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="text-step" data-step="3" data-image="../imgs/me_tea.jpg">
                    <p>I am also a great tea aficionado and enjoy discovering new blends. I even build an app to rate my brews.
                        It's like a glorified notepad, but with a lot more bugs.</p>
                    <br></br>
                    <p>It generally comes as a shock to people that I have never seen Star Wars, so my only knowledge about the Force is that it equal mass times acceleration.</p>
                    <p>This site is a place for me to share what I've been working on — from coding projects to personal thoughts, and maybe the occasional song or book recommendation.</p>
                    <p>Thanks for stopping by, and feel free to explore or reach out!</p>
